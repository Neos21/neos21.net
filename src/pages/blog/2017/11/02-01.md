エイメリーって知らなかったんだけど何か不思議な顔してるなーと思って調べてみたらアフリカン・アメリカンの父と韓国人の母とのハーフらしい。

まぁまぁ声出てますね。

歌詞。

> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na
> 
> Oh, been trying to let it go  
> Trying to keep my eyes closed  
> Trying to keep it just like before  
> The times we never even thought to speak  
> Don't want to tell you what it is  
> Oh wee it felt so serious  
> Got me thinking just too much  
> I want to set it off, but
> 
> [Chorus]  
> It's this one thing that's got me trippin'  
> It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (you did)  
> This one thing my soul may be feeling  
> It's this one thing you did oh oh  
> It's this one thing that caught me slippin'  
> It's this one thing don't want to admit it  
> This one thing and I was so with it  
> It's this one thing you did oh oh oh oh
> 
> Hey, we don't know each other well  
> So what? I keep thinking to myself  
> Memories just keep ringing bells  
> Oh oh, oh oh, oh  
> Hear voices I don't want to understand  
> My car keys are jingling in my hand  
> My high heels are clicking towards your door.  
> Oh oh, oh oh, oh
> 
> [Chorus]
> 
> Maybe I just can't believe it  
> It's this one thing you did oh oh  
> I can't deny, tired of trying  
> Open up the door, but just keep on seeing you  
> I'm hoping you can keep a secret  
> For me, for me, for me  
> But what you did, yeah
> 
> [Chorus]
> 
> Oh oh oh  
> Oh oh oh  
> Oh oh oh  
> Oh oh oh
> 
> Na, na, na, na, na oh  
> Oh  
> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na, na, na, oh  
> Na, na, na
> 
> [Chorus]
> 
> This one thing and I was so with it  
> It's this one thing you did oh oh
> 
> [Chorus]
> 
> Oh oh, oh oh
